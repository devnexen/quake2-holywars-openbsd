Description             : Not very ambitious DM level. Simply enough, my
                          first ever Quake2 level after all. Should be OK
                          for like 2-4 players DM. Mostly experiments in
                          making Quake2-like appearance, each room has a
                          slightly different colour scheme etc... But I'm
                          anyway pretty satisfied with it, and it shows
                          some potential ;)  (Oh well, don't let this text
                          make you think this level's crap... Go to my home
                          page to see what I'm comparing it to =)

Additional Credits to   : ID, and the other guys at ION who even got their
                          Quake2 DM maps out before me! :)
