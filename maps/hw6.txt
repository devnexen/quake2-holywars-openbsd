Description             : This is an exact replica of q1's dm6 (architecture, textures, light). The item placement is also much the same,
				  but because of the extra ammo and weapons in q2 I had to change some things.
				  I didn't include the Railgun and the BFG, because I think they ruin gameplay.
Additional Credits to   : My clan (Sqeletons with Style) for playtesting.
				  ID Software (ofcourse) for making quake2 and quake1 (from wich I got the custom textures)
