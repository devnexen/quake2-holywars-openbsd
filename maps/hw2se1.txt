About UltraViolence 2

In march '98 my old hard disk crashed hence i lost the source
of all of my quake maps. Since then i've been asked many times
to make a conversion of my overrated map Ultraviolence but i was too busy
with Real Life (TM) for doing any mapping....besides that i wasn't
sure that the Q2 version could be as fun as the Quake one was.
Well, a little time ago, the well known AI programmer, Mr. Elusive,
released his latest creation, a demo of the very promising Gladiator Bot.
He also included a neat utility for converting (among the rest) a
.bsp file into a .map file so i tought it was time for converting Ultrav.
As you will see this is just a cheap copy of my original map
but optimized and fully tested in the attempt of mantaining that
old good bloody and berserkesque feeling.....don't expect too much
tough because WinBSPC 0.9  splits the .map in so many small brushes
that discouraged me from either re-texturing or modifying the
original level.

Have a nice day, Escher

P.S. Please, in case you ran across a clearly hacked conversion of
any of my old quake maps, drop me a line and let me know where to get it.
P.S.2 If you're a mantainer of a site devoted to review levels,
please, do NOT support who think that hacking a map and adding a few
colored lights turns him into a cool mapper.....you just would bring
discredit on all of those who worked hard for making the quake's world
a better place to play on.
P.S.3 Please, please, please, do not send me attachments of your
conversion made using WinBSPC.....i just won't give you my permission
to release it even if it looks and plays twice better than the original one.
