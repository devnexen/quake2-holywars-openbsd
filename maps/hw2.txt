Description             : A new Quake2 DM level. I made this from
                          scratch so don't be thinking this is ANOTHER
						  conversion of a Quake1 map.

						  This was made for 2-4 players at the most.  I
						  really wanted to get this done since id didn't
						  give us any DM maps with Quake2.  Enjoy!

						  This is also my attempt at using INTELLIGENT
						  colored lighting.  I think you'll find that
						  each colored light in this map has a purpose
						  and is colored for a reason - a light texture,
						  daylight shining in a window, whatever...

						  BTW, I love feedback.  Glowing reviews and
						  constructive criticism are always welcome!
						  Flames help nobody - if you think this
						  level totally sucks, please explain why.

Additional Credits to   : ID - face Texas and bow!
                          Ben Morris - this is my first publicly released
						  map using Worldcraft and I do have to say that
						  1.5b is finally something I can use!  All previous
						  maps were done in my editor, ToeTag.  But I can't
						  go back now!
