(Note: this file registers publicly distributed versions only)

* 2.21 SE (April 26, 1999)

-> Fixed: server crashing due to "Info string length exceeded"
-> Added: GNU/gcc Makefile to the source code for unix developers

* 2.00 (04/09/98)

-> External parameters for people who like to play with things.
-> Advanced customizable map rotation system.
-> Complete heresy system.
-> All single player stuff stripped away from code (much smaller DLL).
-> Halo movement optimized for Internet games - inertia off by default.
-> Lots of other changes: new halo skin, stuff... Well, you get the idea. 
   It's a total rewrite, after all.


* 1.5 Special Edition (26/01/98) 

-> 5 supported maps from Escher included!
-> Source included in official distribution. 


* 1.41 (11/04/97) 

-> Aww... I credited the head skin to the wrong artist. The only changes 
   from 1.4 are in this TXT file.

-> Client-side support: new sounds and models. 
-> Support for skins.

-> Statistics at the end of the game and with IMPULSE 60. 
-> Support for all of id's maps. 
-> The Halo is now teleported with the owner, to avoid the previous 
   impossibility to recognize the Saint soon after a teleportation. 
-> The Halo shines blue particles when it's free, to improve visibility 
   (exp. on GLQuake). 
-> Deleted unnecessary messages ("You have taken some ammo" and other such 
   useless stuff). 
-> "What to do" message at respawning. 
-> Random respawn spots. 
-> Optimized Halo movement function (now almost twice as fast, useful on 
   slow systems). 
-> Other very minor things and bug fixes. 


* 1.01 (05/19/1997) 

-> Corrected a bug that generated "Unknown entities" when starting certain 
   maps.
